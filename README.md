# 👋 Hi, I’m Francis Prevail (CodeSmith)

I’m a software developer who cares deeply about **how systems are designed, how code ages over time,
and how small decisions affect the whole system**.

I don’t just write code to “make things work” —  
I focus on **structure, clarity, and maintainability**.

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Software

- Software is a **system**, not just files and features  
- Readability and structure matter more than clever tricks  
- Code should be understandable by someone else (or future me)  
- Backend logic should be **predictable, testable, and boring**  
- Automation exists to remove friction, not add complexity  

I prefer solving problems **the right way**, even if it takes longer.

---

## 🔧 What I Actually Work On

### 🧩 Backend Systems
I spend most of my time designing and implementing:
- APIs and backend logic
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Database schemas and data relationships
- Error handling and edge cases
- Admin and internal tooling

My backend work is focused on **clarity of data flow** and **separation of concerns**.

---

### 🌐 Web Applications
I build full-stack applications, but I approach them **from the backend outward**:
- Backend defines rules and structure
- Frontend consumes clean, stable APIs
- UI exists to serve the system, not dominate it

---

### ⚙️ Automation & Tooling
I regularly write small scripts to:
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Simplify development workflows
- Manage environments and system setup

These tools are not flashy — they are practical.

---

## 🛠️ Tools I Use (Because They Fit My Way of Working)

| Area | Tools |
|----|------|
| Languages | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript |
| Backend | Django, Django REST Framework, Node.js |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Supabase |
| Infra | Docker, Nginx |
| Tooling | Git/GitHub, Postman |
| Automation | Python, PowerShell, Bash |

I choose tools based on **stability, ecosystem, and clarity**, not trends.

## 📂 Projects (What They Mean to Me)

### 🛍️ E-Commerce System
Not “just a store” — this project taught me:
- How business rules shape backend design
- Why data modeling matters early
- How auth, orders, and payments interact
- The cost of bad structure over time

---

### 📊 Admin & Management Dashboards
These projects helped me understand:
- Why internal tools matter
- How to design APIs for real users (admins)
- Pagination, filtering, permissions, and performance

---

### ⚙️ Automation Scripts
These reflect how I think:
- If I do something twice, it should be automated
- Tools exist to serve the developer, not impress others

---

## 🧩 Principles I Actually Follow

- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Structure before speed**
- **Systems over features**
- **Consistency beats perfection**
- **Simple solutions age better**
